- 👋 Hi, I’m Erika.
- 👀 I’m interested in human design thinking applied to urban permaculture, ecological family systems, early childhood development, urban co-living and resource sharing models, participatory urban design, and functional movement patterns.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build no-code/low-code apps, javascript, how to write a book, and get really comfortable with public speaking, while working towards certificates in ecological and social permaculture design and in functional training.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an interactive AI guide that helps parents tap into their child's natural independence by experimenting with environmental design and communication patterns as well as other family-centred AI utilties.
