- 👋 Hi, I’m Erika.
- 👀 I’m interested in human design thinking applied to urban permaculture, ecological family systems, early childhood development, urban co-living and resource sharing models, participatory urban design, and functional movement patterns.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build no-code/low-code apps, javascript, how to write a book, and get really comfortable with public speaking, while working towards certificates in ecological and social permaculture design and in functional training.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an AI Montessori-at-home guide that helps parents implement Montessori Design Patterns and learn to use evidence-based communication strategies so they can raise capable and connected kids.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Over the last 3 years started over 1000 native plants from seed that are growing in our gardens and have been shared with community members and plan to continue growing and sharing.
